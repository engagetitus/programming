# Module 1: Programming Fundamentals with Python and HTML

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Programming

### Objectives
- Understand what programming is
- Learn about different programming languages
- Introduction to Python and HTML

### What is Programming?
Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using various languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C++,C#,Ruby,Dart etc.

### Why Learn Programming?
- Problem-solving skills
- Career opportunities
- Automation of tasks
- Creating software and applications

### Types of Programming Languages
- **Low-Level Languages**: Close to machine language, e.g., Assembly.
- **High-Level Languages**: Easier for humans to read and write, e.g., Python, Java, C++.

### Introduction to Python
- High-level, interpreted language
- Easy to read and write
- Widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more

### Introduction to HTML
- Standard markup language for creating web pages
- Defines the structure of web pages
- Works together with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity)

### Basic Programming Concepts
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered to be correctly structured programs in a language.
- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values.
- **Control Structures**: Constructs that dictate the order in which instructions are executed.

### Python Example
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
### Html Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Charles!</h1>
