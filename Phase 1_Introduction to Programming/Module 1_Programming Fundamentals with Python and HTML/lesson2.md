# Module 1: Programming Fundamentals with Python and HTML

## Lesson 2: Basic Syntax and Variables in Python

### Objectives
- Learn the basic syntax of Python
- Understand variables and data types in Python
- Write simple Python programs

### Basic Syntax
- Python uses indentation to define blocks of code
- No need for semicolons to end statements
- Comments are added using `#`

### Variables in Python
- Variables are created when you assign a value to them
- Variable names should be meaningful and follow naming conventions
#### Creating Variables
```python
name = "John"
age = 35
is_alien = True
```
#### Printing Variables
```
print(name)
print(age)
print(is_alien)
```

### Data Types
- **Numbers**: int, float
- **Strings**: str
- **Boolean**: bool
- **Lists**: list
- **Tuples**: tuple
- **Dictionaries**: dict
```
# Integer
x = 10

# Float
y = 10.5

# String
greeting = "Hello, World!"

# Boolean
is_active = False

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
```

### Basic Input and Output
