### Lesson 1: Setting Up Flask

#### Installing Flask

Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, ideal for building web applications quickly and with minimal code. Here's how you can install Flask:

1. **Using pip:**
   ```
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Creating a virtual environment (recommended):**
   - Create a new directory for your Flask project.
   - Navigate to the directory using the terminal.
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

#### Creating a Basic Flask Application

Now, let's create a basic Flask application:

1. **Create a Python file, e.g., `app.py`:**

   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   # Create a Flask instance
   app = Flask(__name__)

   # Define a route and its handler
   @app.route('/')
   def index():
       return 'Hello, World!'

   # Run the Flask application
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

2. **Explanation:**

   - **Flask Instance**: `app = Flask(__name__)` creates a Flask application instance.
   - **Route Definition**: `@app.route('/')` decorator binds a function to a URL.
   - **Handler Function**: `def index():` defines the function handling requests to the root URL (`'/'`).
   - **Run the Application**: `app.run(debug=True)` starts the Flask development server with debugging enabled.

3. **Run the Application:**

   - Save the `app.py` file.
   - In the terminal, ensure your virtual environment is activated.
   - Run the Flask application:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/`.
   - You should see `Hello, World!` displayed in the browser.

#### Additional Considerations:

- **Specifying Host and Port:**
  By default, `app.run()` binds the Flask application to `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`) on port `5000`. You can specify a different host and port:

  ```python
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
  ```

  - `host='0.0.0.0'`: Makes your Flask application accessible from any network interface, allowing other devices on the network to access your application.
  - `port=8080`: Specifies the port number. Ensure it's not in use by other applications.

- **Deployment Options:**
  Flask applications can be deployed in various ways for production:
  - **WSGI Servers**: Deploy Flask with WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
  - **Containers**: Use Docker to containerize your Flask application for easy deployment and scaling.
  - **Cloud Platforms**: Deploy Flask on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

- **Debug Mode (`debug=True`)**:
  - Enables the Flask debugger, showing detailed error messages and auto-reloading the server when code changes.
  - **Caution:** Disable `debug=True` in production for security reasons.
